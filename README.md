This is a webpage for a fake startup called TinDog. (Tinder for dogs!) <br>
HTML used to create the basic layout of information. <br>
CSS used for styling. Added Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons.<br>
Bootstrap used to create the drop down navigation bar when viewed on mobile devices. Bootstrap was also used to create the carousel that can
be used to scroll through all the testimonials. The pricing section was created using Bootstrap cards. Bootstrap fluid containters were used
to make the web page responsive on all device sizes.
